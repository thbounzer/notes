## What I would recommend to people?

### Terraform/Opentofu projects:
  * [AWS terraform best practices](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-terraform-best-practices)

### C Projects
  * [The REDIS github repo](https://github.com/redis/redis)
    Redis repo is a reference for Open Source development practices. Very well documented, minimal inclusion of external dependencies, clear C code.
